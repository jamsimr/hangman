# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

The milestone_2.py file contains a list of 5 words, a method to pick one of those words at random and asks the user for the letter of their first guess. The user's input is tested to see if a single character has been entered.
